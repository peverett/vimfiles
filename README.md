# My VIMRC and GVIMRC files

There are many like them, but these ones are mine!

## VIM - The one editor to rule them all!

Download it from here: http://www.vim.org/

## Configuration

1. VIM looks in various places for the VIMRC and GVIMRC files. ':version' to see
   where.
2. On windows it's worthwhile explicitely defining a HOME environment var.
3. Navigate to your home directory (~).
4. Create a subdirectory for your vim config files
..* \vimfiles - on Windows
..* /.vim - on Linux
5. Clone this repo there and you're halfway home. 

```
> git clone https://github.com/peverett/vimfiles.git
